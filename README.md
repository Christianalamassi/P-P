- I confirmed the project is easy to use and the nav bar, the header, sign up and about us are easy to understand for the user. 

#### I found three errors in HTML, they are fixed :

- The address element wasn't allowed as a child of element h3.
- End tag <main> was seen, but there were open elements.
- Unclosed element section.
